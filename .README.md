A short simulation of boats arriving to a dock represented by an array of 64 elements. Different boats got different demands on how long the will stay in dock and how much space they take up, assigment is to make algoritm to fill the harbour best as possible and make it to refill over days running after the users interaction. When a boats expected visit time run due the boat leaves and open up new space for new boats to dock at. 
The solution also contains a few extra methods to be able to calculate some statistics of the boats docked in harbour. Different boats have different prop values and takes up different much space in the dock.
